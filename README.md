# Web-Based AI Tool for Generating Educational Content

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based AI tool that can dynamically generate educational content based on a given course title. The system will leverage Python, HTML, JavaScript, and OpenAI's API to create educational resources such as summaries, lecture notes, and quiz questions. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for educators, students, and content creators to quickly generate relevant learning material, making content creation more efficient and personalized.

## Key Objectives Include

- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Use OpenAI’s API to generate educational content such as lecture notes, course summaries, and quiz questions based on user input.
- **User Interface Development**: Create a web-based interface using HTML and JavaScript to allow users to input course titles and view the generated content.
- **Backend Integration**: Develop the backend using Python to handle API requests, data processing, and content generation.
- **Dynamic and Interactive**: Implement a dynamic system that responds in real-time to user inputs and generates unique content for each request.
- **Customizable Content Output**: Allow users to customize the length and format of the generated content (e.g., detailed lecture notes vs. brief summaries).
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system is scalable to handle multiple users and requests, with the potential to integrate additional AI models or APIs in the future.

## Features

### 1. AI-Driven Content Generation
   - **Description**: Uses OpenAI’s API to generate educational materials tailored to user-provided course titles. The AI creates relevant content such as summaries, detailed lecture notes, or even quiz questions, providing users with personalized learning materials.

### 2. User-Friendly Web Interface
   - **Description**: A simple, intuitive interface built using HTML and JavaScript, allowing users to input a course title, select content preferences, and view the generated material directly within their browser.

### 3. Python Backend
   - **Description**: The backend is developed using Python to handle API calls, process user inputs, and communicate with the AI model. This ensures seamless data processing and integration with the frontend.

### 4. Real-Time Content Customization
   - **Description**: Users can specify their preferences for the content output, such as selecting whether they want a brief summary or a more detailed explanation, and the system generates content in real-time based on these inputs.

### 5. Quiz Question Generation
   - **Description**: Provides an option to generate quiz questions related to the given course title. These questions can be multiple-choice, short answer, or true/false, helping educators create assessments more efficiently.

### 6. Scalability and Extensibility
   - **Description**: The system is designed to scale, allowing multiple users to generate content simultaneously. It also supports future integration of additional AI models or APIs to expand its capabilities.

### 7. Comprehensive Documentation
   - **Description**: The project includes detailed documentation, outlining how to set up the tool, use the AI features, and extend the system for additional use cases. The documentation supports both end-users and developers interested in modifying or contributing to the project.

## Goals

- **Leverage AI for Education**: Utilize AI to create relevant and accurate educational content based on user-provided inputs, making learning resources more accessible.
- **Create a User-Friendly Platform**: Build a web-based interface that is easy to use and accessible to both educators and students.
- **Optimize Backend Performance**: Ensure the backend efficiently processes user requests, enabling fast and accurate content generation.
- **Enable Customizable Learning Materials**: Provide users with flexible options for the type of content generated, catering to different learning styles and needs.
- **Promote Scalability and Extensibility**: Develop the tool in a way that supports future enhancements, including additional content generation features or integration with other AI models.
- **Provide Comprehensive Support**: Include clear documentation and support resources to make it easier for others to understand, implement, and expand the system.

## Benefits
